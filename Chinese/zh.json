    "dialog44": "你不是在白费力气。我们将激活长老机制。我会告诉你我的计划，但首先，你需要知道一些事情。其中一台机器正在跟踪你。",
    "dialog45": "什么？！",
    "dialog46": "越来越近了！很快就到了！好吧，我们有点时间……听着，你知道迷宫吗？",
    "dialog47": "迷宫？有数据库的地区？",
    "dialog48": "是的，阿尔马迪数据库。它们可能包含激活长老机制的方法的信息。",
    "dialog49": "以前没有人打开过它们，这可能是因为唯一可以打开这些数据库的是老机制。去迷宫，$$。",
    "dialog50": "就这样，机器已经进入这个区域了！我会尽量放慢速度，离开这里！",

    "dialog51": "你擅长逃离机器。现在打开那些数据库。",

    "dialog57": "我们是阿尔马迪人。很久以前，我们的文明和其他文明一样。后来它被冲突撕裂，被无知蒙蔽。我们曾居住过数千个世界，但仍然没有找到和平。",
    "dialog58": "唯一能让我们超越他人的是时间。我们来自最古老、最慢的地区。我们存在于一切之前。我们有时间从错误中吸取教训。",
    "dialog59": "在我们获得和平之后，我们发现我们的无限宇宙只是另一层，另一个部分。",
    "dialog60": "我们去了其他地区，殖民了他们，发现了外星文明。看到他们都犯了我们很久以前就不再犯的错误，真是太痛苦了。我们得做点什么。",
    "dialog61": "在发现其他部分之后，我们的力量开始呈指数增长。我们以为有了这种力量，有了对最大秘密的了解，我们就能停止战争、苦难、混乱……",
    "dialog62": "我们建立了光的机制并释放它们，希望改变未来。我们做到了。但是出了点问题。我们把一切都搞得更糟了。我们创造了腐朽……",
    "dialog63": "首先，这种异常现象只在少数几个部门出现。然后开始扩散。",
    "dialog64": "一切都崩溃了。什么都没起作用。黑暗吞噬了我们的思想和世界。",
    "dialog65": "我们必须迅速采取行动。腐朽已蔓延到除最深的8个部门以外的所有部门。我们别无选择。",
    "dialog66": "我们已经瓦解了所有被腐朽影响的部门……",
    "dialog67": "那些在他们的部门崩溃中幸存下来的人起来反对我们。",
    "dialog68": "他们称自己为粉碎者。他们的目标是摧毁我们的部门，就像我们摧毁他们的部门一样。",
    "dialog69": "但我们的家不仅仅是另一个部门。如果我们的部门被摧毁，它会带走一切。",
    "dialog70": "我们准备向粉碎者开战。我们建立了机构，实体室。",
    "dialog71": "我们不需要他们，但是我们的敌人，在无限仇恨的驱使下，已经成为一个严重的威胁。即使对我们也是认真的。",
    "dialog72": "他们用濒死恒星的核心金属建造了他们的舰队，他们制造了机器，并给了他们病态的、残废的情报。他们牺牲了身上所有的优点来获得与我们同等的权力。",
    "dialog73": "然后他们袭击了我们……",
    "dialog74": "七区被摧毁了。星球融化，恒星被带走，作为武器的燃料消耗。",
    "dialog75": "他们在那里打败了我们，但代价是什么？第七区可能是他们的新家。但他们一心想摧毁我们的家园。",
    "dialog76": "黑暗时期到来。我们被消耗我们殖民地的腐朽所削弱。我们接二连三地进攻，无法防守。经过几个世纪的和平，我们不得不参加有史以来最大的战争。",
    "dialog77": "但每一次失败都让我们更加努力。我们建造了新的战舰，唤醒了被遗忘的武器，释放了被禁止的机制。",
    "dialog78": "当粉碎者攻击第六区时一切都结束了。我们知道，如果我们这次失败了，他们会变得更加强大，没有什么能够阻止他们。",
    "dialog79": "我们把所有的东西都转移到第六区，在第六区文明的帮助下，我们打败了粉碎者。在我们把他们推到第七区之前，他们成功地摧毁了第六区。",
    "dialog80": "但战争终于结束了。我们复活了六区，抹去了所有的碎片，把他们的机器驱逐到七区。从那以后我们就没什么可做的了。",
    "dialog81": "我们必须做的阻止腐朽和打败粉碎者的事情改变了我们。损失太多了，都是我们的错。",
    "dialog82": "我们已经回家了，我们永远不会离开它。我们的时代已经结束了。",
    "dialog83": "我们已经让机器进入睡眠状态，让它们来保护机器。如果再次需要这些机制，就必须把它们带到第六区核心的帕拉里斯克才能启动。",
    "dialog84": "我们的敌人是粉碎者机器……",
    "dialog85": "糟糕的是，数据库没有解释为什么这些机器试图摧毁第六区。",
    "dialog86": "指挥官，我已经打开了数据库。",
    "dialog87": "你找到如何激活长老机关了吗？",
    "dialog88": "我需要把它带到帕拉里斯克。",
    "dialog89": "帕拉里斯克？那是阿尔马迪要塞，在核心深处。",
    "dialog90": "我真的不想送你去那儿。但没有更好的选择。",
    "dialog91": "我会像往常一样突破。",
    "dialog92": "我希望你会的。祝你好运。",

    "dialog160": "到这里真是噩梦，别告诉我它还没动。",
    "dialog161": "对不起，发动机仍然锁着，我不能对机器做什么。",
    "dialog162": "然后他们需要解锁。",

    "dialog166": "那就让我们离开核心。",

    "dialog167": "嘿，Eweri，自从我搜了迷宫里的数据库后，我就一直在想腐朽的事情。",
    "dialog168": "腐朽是那么多可怕事情的起因，到底是什么？",
    "dialog169": "我不知道我能告诉你多少，但是……",
    "dialog170": "当腐朽出现时，阿尔马迪人向腐朽的地区发送了研究探针。他们派出了数以百万计的探测器，但只有少数探测器返回。",
    "dialog171": "每个返回的探测器都携带了不可能的数据。起初，数据似乎已损坏，但很快就清楚了数据是正确的。是宇宙被腐蚀了。",
    "dialog172": "……",
    "dialog173": "腐朽扭曲了宇宙的本质。所有不变的东西都变得不稳定，这些不稳定的东西扩散的速度比可能的要快。",
    "dialog174": "阻止腐朽把一切变成腐朽的唯一方法就是切断与腐朽的联系。这就是为什么衰退的行业不得不崩溃的原因。这就是为什么粉碎者必须被杀。",
    "dialog175": "我以为机器是最坏的。",
    "dialog176": "不幸的是，他们没有。",

    "dialog185": "Eweri，我知道现在不是谈话的好时机，但我需要问你一件事。你真的能摧毁这些机器吗？",
    "dialog186": "能。",
    "dialog187": "你在与粉碎者的战争中与机器作战，为什么不摧毁它们？",
    "dialog188": "我不知道，$$。我是被创造出来的，然后我被扔进了宇宙中最大的战争……当它结束时，我被关闭了。我想阿尔马迪人把七区的机器留给我了。",
    "dialog189": "但这意味着第六区的入侵，无数的死亡，毁灭……这一切本来是可以避免的！",
    "dialog190": "也许吧。但这次我不会被淘汰。",
    "dialog191": "现在很糟糕，但马上就要结束了。",
    "dialog192": "……",
    "dialog193": "我们走。",

    "dialog194": "你还记得在你被唤醒之前发生了什么吗？",
    "dialog195": "勉强吧。当老机械装置不起作用时，我不能思考，我不能感觉，我只是一个自动系统。我那时候做的事，是自动的。",
    "dialog196": "你做了什么？",
    "dialog197": "你在迷宫里寻找知识，所以我从他们那里得到了重要的数据。",
    "dialog198": "你在否定之地和机械兵作战，所以我把武器系统和机械装置同步了。",
    "dialog199": "你能再来一次吗？",
    "dialog205": "我可以，但是……你需要准备好与机器作战，能够摧毁这样的奴仆不会让你成为一个更好的战士。",
    "dialog206": "再来一次。",
    "dialog207": "好……准备好。",
    "dialog208": "Attydr vega.",

    "dialog209": "指挥官，我已经启动了长老机制。请允许我把你介绍给Eweri。",

    "dialog216": "现在我们的任务是打开机械装置的全部动力。",
    "dialog217": "真是个好消息！但是，快点，自从你从核心回来以后，机器变得更加激进了。",
    "dialog218": "机器知道我醒了。他们会尽一切努力阻止我们。",

    "dialog236": "我改天再告诉你。",

    "dialog237": "Well... When I was young, I was told, that I was bound to become a fighter.",
    "dialog238": "Being a fighter before the Machine invasion was different than it is now. When the Aspil Armada invited me to become a fighter, I refused.",
    "dialog239": "I didn't knew that I have no choice. I need combat.",
    "dialog240": "Back then small fights used to sate me. First, it was just simulations of combat. Then brawls.",
    "dialog241": "I was able to get the fights I needed without killing anyone.",
    "dialog242": "But that didn't last long. I became too dangerous, so I had to stop fighting.",
    "dialog243": "I began seeing things, hallucinate. And it kept getting worse.",
    "dialog244": "But then the invasion began.",
    "dialog245": "I remember I was walking in a street. It was evening. Sky above my head lit up, but I thought it was just a hallucination.",
    "dialog246": "Then I saw people dying, I saw bringers falling. I fled. The next day I joined the Aspil Armada.",
    "dialog247": "I passed training, got my first spaceship and began to fight the Machine minions. Hallucinations left one by one and soon I was the best fighter in Aspil Armada.",
    "dialog248": "Everything changed so quickly. The Machines crushed the Aspil Armada and those fighters who survived, including me, joined the growing Negati Armada.",
    "dialog249": "I secured regions, led refugees out of war zones, and destroyed hundreds of the Machine minions... Until one day I was sent to protect the carrier of a mysterious artifact.",
    "dialog250": "And that's where we are.",

    "dialog251": "What is this place?",

    "dialog257": "Couldn't agree more.",

    "dialog258": "What are these structures?",
    "dialog259": "Matter fusion facilities. They are forging new parts for military spaceships.",
    "dialog260": "That's why it felt so familiar. I like the radiation these structures emit.",
    "dialog261": "Really? Why?",
    "dialog262": "Well, probably because I was created in a matter fusion facility. Being close to them makes me feel good.",
    "dialog263": "And the radiation is very nice, so many colors, free particles, exotic ions, binary atoms... I wish you could see it.",
    "dialog264": "We are so different...",
    "dialog265": "More than you think.",
    "dialog266": "Hmm... Then what is the biggest difference?",
    "dialog267": "Well, you are made from atoms and I am made from naons.",
    "dialog268": "That's interesting.",

    "dialog269": "Ask Eweri to tell you more?",

    "dialog270": "But I think we should go get the Key.",

    "dialog271": "Can you tell me how you were created?",
    "dialog272": "I can try... It's hard for me to tell when exactly I began. Sometimes I think that I always existed in one form or another.",
    "dialog273": "I just know that I was taken from the shadow of the Universe. From unimaginable emptyness outside it.",
    "dialog274": "I was not who I am now. I was a fragment of something greater. I still remember that feeling of separation.",
    "dialog275": "I still remember soft voice of my creator. After I heard it, I no longer wanted to return from where I was taken. I wanted to become something and see the light.",
    "dialog276": "I was brought into existence as a naonic reflection of my creator. I woke up in Aco Veloom Tezari that shaped me. It was incredible.",
    "dialog277": "What happened next?",
    "dialog278": "...",
    "dialog279": "I ripped Aco Veloom Tezari in half.",
    "dialog280": "I only wanted to move a little. But naons are not good for atoms.",
    "dialog281": "So I was put inside the Mechanism. If the engines of the Mechanism are active, I can influence everything that is outside it without causing too much damage.",
    "dialog282": "This time you're going to need to cause some damage.",
    "dialog283": "I am looking forward to it.",

    "dialog285": "The Machine has devoured the Key!",

    "dialog312": "$$, Eweri! The Machines are attacking! They are headed towards Colowis, Mzenim and Tridenkor. They want to crush the last resistance. I cannot stop them.",
    "dialog313": "We're coming!",

    "dialog327": "I still don't understand what are the Machines doing in Sector Six.",
    "dialog328": "The Shatterers are gone and the Machines don't have a free will, they couldn't have decided to attack Sector Six by themselves.",
    "dialog329": "Maybe some of the Shatterers survived?",
    "dialog330": "No, that's impossible. Everything that was from collapsed Sectors were erased from the Universe.",
    "dialog331": "Hmm...",
    "dialog332": "It's not the only thing that worries me about this situation.",
    "dialog333": "The Machines and their minions are not trying to occupy Sector Six. They are methodically breaking everything down. They are trying to empty Sector Six. But for what reason?",
    "dialog334": "If the Machines wanted to attack Almadian Sector, Negati Armada couldn't stop them.",
    "dialog335": "Maybe it's their revenge?",
    "dialog336": "No, I don't think so.",
    "dialog337": "I'm afraid that this is more than invasion.",
    "dialog338": "We don't need to know why it's happening. We just need to stop it.",
    "dialog339": "I hope you are right, $$.",

    "dialog340": "Choose next fight.",

    "dialog341": "Be careful, I am getting anomalous results from my sensors.",
    "dialog342": "How bad is it?",
    "dialog343": "It appears that there are multiple intertwined temporal fields nearby.",
    "dialog344": "We should leave this area. Unless...",
    "dialog345": "Unless?",
    "dialog346": "We could go right where the temporal fields connect. I think it would take us to a different timeline.",
    "dialog347": "Do you think it's worth the risk?",
    "dialog348": "If you will enter time vortex story missions and regions will be reset. Region levels will increase by 30.",
    "dialog349": "You will also lose access to activities and Restoration War reward.",
    "dialog350": "Nothing else will change.",
    "dialog351": "Reset story and regions?",

    "dialog353": "What's the situation?",
    "dialog354": "We're being crushed by the Machine! I'll have to order to retreat if I'll keep losing ships. Do something!",
    "dialog355": "Endrawe exelo attydr. Endrawe galan!",
    "dialog356": "This shield will protect your armada from the Machine attacks.",
    "dialog357": "Great, maybe I can save at least some of my bringers.",
    "dialog358": "$$, take me to the Machine. It's time to end this nightmare.",

    "dialog361": "...",
    "dialog362": "Attydr vega!",

    "dialog363": "It's running away!",
    "dialog364": "No!",
    "dialog365": "Go after it! It's going to Colowis!",

    "dialog366": "Colowis is overrun by powerful minions! $$, you'll have to protect it until I'll secure Tridenkor.",
    "dialog367": "What about the Machine?",
    "dialog368": "If you will attack the Machine now, minions will devastate the region.",

    "dialog369": "That's it, attack the Machine!",
    "dialog370": "On it.",

    "dialog371": "This region is the last thing it will scar!",
    "dialog372": "Wrong.",
    "dialog373": "Okay, then we will destroy you instead!",
    "dialog374": "Attydr valas! Vega!",
    "dialog375": "Finish him, $$!",

    "dialog376": "...",
    "dialog377": "Don't let it escape!",
    "dialog378": "I'm trying!",
    "dialog379": "Xelrawe exelo attydr!",

    "dialog380": "Where is it?!",
    "dialog381": "The Machine is leaving Colowis.",
    "dialog382": "We can still get to it!",
    "dialog383": "You can't, Mzenim has been attacked, we are needed there!",
    "dialog384": "Damn it!",

    "dialog385": "Don't let the Machine escape this time.",
    "dialog386": "The Machines know I can defeat them. They are going to hit and run, again and again... I know this tactic.",
    "dialog387": "I need to disrupt it.",
    "dialog388": "What is your plan?",
    "dialog389": "I will pin the Machines to this dimension. They will not be able to leave it.",
    "dialog390": "When that will happen, the Machines will hit us with everything they got.",
    "dialog391": "...",
    "dialog392": "You need to leave, commander. This is not a fight your Armada can endure.",
    "dialog393": "Understood. I will start the evacuation.",
    "dialog394": "Let's go, $$.",

    "dialog395": "That's it, I've done all I can. Negati Armada will leave the region soon.",
    "dialog396": "Let's begin.",
    "dialog397": "Protect me while I focus.",

    "dialog398": "Innex exelo attydr! Teract!",
    "dialog399": "Mistake.",
    "dialog400": "Destroy it!",
    "dialog401": "...",

    "dialog402": "Stop!",
    "dialog403": "What?",
    "dialog404": "The Machine has the Decay inside! If you will destroy it, the Decay will be released!",
    "dialog405": "Why should we believe you?",
    "dialog406": "Attydr ullur.",
    "dialog407": "What are you-",
    "dialog408": "Oh no...",
    "dialog409": "Eweri?",
    "dialog410": "She is right.",
    "dialog411": "But that means... That means we cannot save Sector Six.",
    "dialog412": "I'm sorry, $$. There's nothing I can do.",

    "dialog415": "Where are we going, $$?",
    "dialog416": "$$?",
    "dialog417": "I will fight.",
    "dialog418": "I will fight even there is nothing I can do to make things better.",
    "dialog419": "I don't need hope to fight. I can just... Fight.",
    "dialog420": "$$...",
    "dialog421": "Let me think.",
    "dialog422": "How did Almadians defeat the Machines during the Shatterer War?",
    "dialog423": "We killed the Shatterers and the Machines became inactive. Without orders, they don't do anything.",
    "dialog424": "That means some of the Shatterers survived.",
    "dialog425": "No, I think the Machines no longer need orders from the Shatterers... They have malfunctioned. Or maybe the Decay have warped their sentience.",
    "dialog426": "Then we need to find a way to contain the Decay after we destroy the Machines.",
    "dialog427": "There is no way.",
    "dialog428": "You did not know about the Decay in the Machines. Maybe you don't know something else about the Decay.",
    "dialog429": "You could be right.",
    "dialog430": "We need to know everything Almadians knew about the Decay.",
    "dialog431": "That knowledge is probably in Labyrinth with the darkest Almadian secrets. Protected by many layers of encryption and spread across all databases.",
    "dialog432": "It's too much even for me.",
    "dialog433": "What if you had control of all data devices in Sector Six? Would that be enough to get the information we need from Labyrinth?",
    "dialog434": "Probably. But how could I do that?",
    "dialog435": "There's data processing hub in Silaar, it is connected to all data devices on Sector Six.",
    "dialog436": "Okay, take me to Silaar and I'll see what I can do.",

    "dialog437": "Silaar. Aspil Armada was destroyed near those structures. Just looking at them makes me feel sick.",
    "dialog438": "It was the early days of the invasion. We went to destroy a small swarm of minions.",
    "dialog439": "We were doing fine. I took down veteran and heavy, other minions were smaller. We were supposed to win.",
    "dialog440": "Then one of the Machines appeared. I don't think you've seen that one.",
    "dialog441": "After five seconds most of the fighters were dead. I managed to get close to the Machine. I didn't knew how powerful these things are. Nobody did.",
    "dialog442": "I burned six thousand ether, but the Machine didn't even react to my attacks. It was invulnerable. And it was crushing Aspil Armada with such arrogance.",
    "dialog443": "It didn't care to aim properly. That thing knew it was going to win.",
    "dialog444": "...",
    "dialog445": "I remember bravery and hope in those early days. People of Sector Six were almost happy that someone dared to attack us.",
    "dialog446": "It was chance for us to show how powerful and united we were.",
    "dialog447": "We managed to defend Sector Six for a few days. Then we started losing cities, planets, entire regions.",
    "dialog448": "There was no transition between our prosperous life and this hopeless fight.",
    "dialog449": "And now I know... Even Almadians could not defeat the Machines.",
    "dialog450": "...",
    "dialog451": "I believed that you would save us, Eweri.",
    "dialog452": "I don't know if you can imagine how I felt when my weapons infused with your power started tearing the Machine apart.",
    "dialog453": "The end of my Universe was cancelled.",
    "dialog454": "...",
    "dialog455": "Now I don't believe anything. But that will not stop me.",
    "dialog456": "And I will not let you stop fighting.",
    "dialog457": "We have no right to give up.",
    "dialog458": "We really don't.",

    "dialog459": "Do you know who is Imeria?",
    "dialog460": "She was Tetragon, one of the Almadian Armada's commanders. I heard about her.",
    "dialog461": "Now my sensors recognize her as Nonagon. A guardian.",
    "dialog462": "I think she looks after the things Almadians left in Sector Six.",
    "dialog463": "Hm, I wonder what she will think about this.",
    "dialog464": "About what?",
    "dialog465": "Eron tessariome teracti.#This area is restricted.",
    "dialog466": "Lir inexaal.#Leave immediately.",
    "dialog467": "Right.",

    "dialog468": "Ixanumex atir.#Intruders detected.",
    "dialog469": "Palinn vega ixanumex.#Attempting to elimitate intruders.",

    "dialog470": "This looks promising.",
    "dialog471": "Attydr innex exelo!",
    "dialog472": "It's working! I am connected to everything, even Labyrinth.",
    "dialog473": "Stop!",
    "dialog474": "Not again. What do you want now?",
    "dialog475": "Entity, I demand you to disconnect.",
    "dialog476": "Why would I listen to you?",
    "dialog477": "The knowledge you are trying to acquire is forbidden.",
    "dialog478": "Leave or I will be forced to destroy the hub.",
    "dialog479": "Destroy it and I will destroy the Machines. Or just one. One would be enough, right?",
    "dialog480": "$$!",
    "dialog481": "You wouldn't dare to release the Decay.",
    "dialog482": "You are wrong. ",
    "dialog483": "Leave.",
    "dialog484": "You will regret this.",
    "dialog485": "Eweri, continue.",

    "dialog486": "So much data, it's getting difficult to focus.",
    "dialog487": "$$, Sector Six was not resurrected!",
    "dialog488": "What?",
    "dialog489": "What Almadians did to Sector Six after it was destroyed by the Shatterers was not resurrection.",
    "dialog490": "It was reconstruction. Sector Six was turned into a weapon.",
    "dialog491": "A weapon?",
    "dialog492": "What this file says is unbelievable! There's programmed particles in every atom of Sector Six.",
    "dialog493": "What does that mean?",
    "dialog494": "It's possible control everything in Sector Six with a special key. Absolutely everything.",
    "dialog495": "Now I understand why Imeria didn't want us to have this knowledge.",
    "dialog496": "This explains everything! Those strange minions that gather Sector Six particles are reprogramming them to obey the Machines!",
    "dialog497": "The Machines want to turn Sector Six into a weapon and destroy Almadian Sector!",
    "dialog498": "So if we will not stop them the Universe is doomed. But we already know that.",
    "dialog499": "True.",

    "dialog500": "I'm almost done decrypting the deepest database layers.",
    "dialog501": "The knowledge about the Decay should be in them.",
    "dialog502": "Here, the Decay files.",
    "dialog503": "Hmm... I can't find anything useful. Just the official reports about the Mechanisms of Light and all that.",
    "dialog504": "...",
    "dialog505": "We have failed again.",
    "dialog506": "Wait! Apparently, there was a group of scientists that were experimenting with the Decay.",
    "dialog507": "Results of their research have been erased and their leader, Techamer, was imprisoned in Sector Five. It says that he is not allowed to die, for some reason. Strange.",
    "dialog508": "Then we need to talk to him.",
    "dialog509": "How can we get to Sector Five?",
    "dialog510": "Through High Path. I think I have the permission to activate the old arrays.",
    "dialog511": "To High Path, then.",

    "dialog512": "$$, Eweri, where are you?",
    "dialog513": "Commander, we have received new information. We need to travel to Sector Five and find a new way to stop the Machines.",
    "dialog514": "What?",
    "dialog515": "We cannot destroy the Machines because doing that would permanently damage the structure of the Universe.",
    "dialog516": "That sounds bad.",
    "dialog517": "And is much worse than it sounds. We'll be back as soon as we can.",
    "dialog518": "You don't have much time. The Machines are still recovering from recent battles, but it won't take long before they start attacking again.",
    "dialog519": "I understand.",
    "dialog520": "Good.",

    "dialog521": "Tell me what to do, Eweri.",
    "dialog522": "I need to enable decelerator stabilizers. There is one in the vicinity, find it.",

    "dialog523": "Stop!",
    "dialog524": "Are you insane? We're fighting for the survival of the entire Universe!",
    "dialog525": "The knowledge that you have stolen from Labyrinth will end everything much faster than the Machines will.",
    "dialog526": "You don't even know what I am doing!",
    "dialog527": "But I know what will happen.",
    "dialog528": "Okay, but you can't even stop us.",
    "dialog529": "I can slow you down.",
    "dialog530": "Get out of my way!",

    "dialog531": "This wall is not supposed to be here.",
    "dialog532": "That is Imeria's work. Remove it.",

    "dialog533": "Innex exelo attydr!",
    "dialog534": "Nice!",
    "dialog535": "Thank you.",

    "dialog536": "I can't, I don't have one of the Keys.",
    "dialog537": "Okay, I'll do this myself.",
    "dialog538": "Requesting equipment: Siege cannon.",
    "dialog539": "Request granted.",
    "dialog540": "Equipment delivered.",

    "dialog541": "Here is one of the stabilizers.",
    "dialog542": "Attydr!",
    "dialog543": "It is done. Take me to the next one.",

    "dialog544": "Imeria?",
    "dialog545": "Everything is wrong.",
    "dialog546": "I'm trying to do the right thing. But it's too late.",
    "dialog547": "What are you talking about?",

    "dialog548": "About the Machine that you attempted to destroy.",
    "dialog549": "I had to take it away, keep it stable.",
    "dialog550": "After that, I tried to reach you.",

    "dialog551": "I barely had time to tell you about the Decay inside the Machines.",
    "dialog552": "You are always at the epicenter of war.",
    "dialog553": "And now you are corrupted by the forbidden knowledge.",
    "dialog554": "I have to stop you. But if I will stop you, the Machines will win.",
    "dialog555": "No, I can't. I can't do any of this.",
    "dialog556": "Kill me, Entity.",

    "dialog557": "What?!",
    "dialog558": "I am tethered to Paralisk. I cannot die.",
    "dialog559": "Only you can kill me.",
    "dialog560": "I don't-",
    "dialog561": "I have no choice and I won't let you have one.",
    "dialog562": "Attydr vega!",

    "dialog563": "I am so tired.",
    "dialog564": "Please.",
    "dialog565": "I... $$, should I?",

    "dialog566": "Kill Imeria?",

    "dialog567": "Do what she wants.",
    "dialog568": "She doesn't deserve this suffering.",
    "dialog569": "Thank you.",
    "dialog570": "Vega.",
    "dialog571": "...",

    "dialog572": "We're not killers.",
    "dialog573": "No! You cannot have a choice!",
    "dialog574": "Maybe there's something else I can do.",
    "dialog575": "Lix exelo. Attydr.",
    "dialog576": "What did you do?",
    "dialog577": "She is sleeping.",

    "dialog578": "Let's go, $$.",

    "dialog579": "Attydr!",

    "dialog580": "Lix! Innex!",
    "dialog581": "What happened?",
    "dialog582": "This stabilizer is protected by laser grid!",
    "dialog583": "I have disabled it, but it will activate itself soon. Hurry!",
    "dialog584": "Attydr!",
    "dialog585": "High Path is now active.",

    "dialog586": "Aon attydr!",

    "dialog587": "Altering curvature...",
    "dialog588": "Regulating pressure...",
    "dialog589": "Setting superposition...",

    "dialog590": "Executing deceleration...",
    "dialog591": "Executing acceleration...",

    "dialog592": "Through this access line, we can get to Techamer's cell.",
    "dialog593": "Prepare to fight, White Grid has activated its defense units.",
    "dialog594": "I am ready.",

    "dialog595": "There are thousands of those cells.",
    "dialog596": "They are for Shatterer supporters, malfunctioned weapons, traitors, decayed objects.",
    "dialog597": "And for people like Techamer?",
    "dialog598": "Yes.",
    "dialog599": "The cell we are looking for is in the middle of this grid horizon.",
    "dialog600": "Then let's get there.",

    "dialog601": "It is this one.",
    "dialog602": "Attydr!",
    "dialog603": "Techamer?",
    "dialog604": "Hello! Who am I talking to?",
    "dialog605": "I am $$, fighter of the Negati Armada.",
    "dialog606": "Negati? That's in Sector Six, right?",
    "dialog607": "Yes.",
    "dialog608": "And you are?",
    "dialog609": "I am Eweri. One of the Naonic Entities.",
    "dialog610": "That's interesting.",
    "dialog611": "We need your help, Techamer.",
    "dialog612": "The Shatterer Machines have invaded Sector Six and are destroying it.",
    "dialog613": "We need to stop them without unleashing the Decay.",
    "dialog614": "Is it possible?",
    "dialog615": "...",
    "dialog616": "Free me and I will try to help you.",
    "dialog617": "Before I was imprisoned, I tried to perform my biggest experiment. Almadians have found out about my plans, killed my assistants and locked me up.",
    "dialog618": "If I would perform that experiment, a lot would be revealed about the nature of the Decay.",
    "dialog619": "Maybe with that knowledge, I would be able to help you.",
    "dialog620": "We are ready for everything.",
    "dialog621": "Release him, Eweri.",
    "dialog622": "Are you sure?",
    "dialog623": "Almadians wouldn't have imprisoned him without a good reason.",
    "dialog624": "Yes. We have to do this.",
    "dialog625": "...",
    "dialog626": "Attydr innex!",

    "dialog627": "I am finally free! I spent thousands of years in that cell.",
    "dialog628": "Why?",
    "dialog629": "I was afraid that Almadians would kill me, so I inserted the Decay Chamber inside my body.",
    "dialog630": "If I died, it would release the Decay, so they made sure I couldn't die.",
    "dialog631": "And yes, I was inspired by the Machines to do that.",
    "dialog632": "Now I know how bad of an idea that was. But because of that, I understand your problem very well.",
    "dialog633": "So what do you need for your experiment?",
    "dialog634": "I need a quiet, empty region, far from Nonagon sensors.",
    "dialog635": "Then we have to return to Sector Six.",

    "dialog636": "So that's how it looks like.",
    "dialog637": "What should I do now?",
    "dialog638": "Go to White Grid. That's where he is imprisoned.",

    "dialog639": "Techamer, there is something that bothers me.",
    "dialog640": "How did you get the Decay to make your Chamber? Wasn't the Decay destroyed by Almadians with all those Sectors?",
    "dialog641": "Are you sure you want to know that? It's forbidden knowledge. You know the punishment for having it.",
    "dialog642": "Ask what is the punishment?",
    "dialog643": "Complete deletion from existence, including everything that was in contact with you after you have acquired that knowledge.",
    "dialog644": "Everything?",
    "dialog645": "Yes. Almadians are willing to erase entire worlds to keep that information hidden.",
    "dialog646": "It was worse for me. I was imprisoned for thousands of years and I couldn't even lose my sanity.",
    "dialog647": "I'm not afraid. Almadians can't know that I have that knowledge.",
    "dialog648": "Yes, as long as you don't enter the range of neural scanner.",
    "dialog649": "What?!",
    "dialog650": "It would detect forbidden knowledge within your mind and alert Almadians.",
    "dialog651": "There was one of those terrible things in Scrambler Belt. It's probably dormant, so you should be safe.",
    "dialog652": "So, do you still want to know?",
    "dialog653": "Do you still want to know?",
    "dialog654": "I need to know.",
    "dialog655": "The truth is that Almadians did not eliminate the Decay when decayed Sectors were collapsed.",
    "dialog656": "Those Sectors were too warped to be destroyed completely. They still exist in their decayed state.",
    "dialog657": "The Decay is there and it's spreading through remaining connections.",
    "dialog658": "Almadians have closed all physical connections to decayed Sectors, but non-physical connections still exist.",
    "dialog659": "Non-physical connections?",
    "dialog660": "Yeah, informational and temporal.",
    "dialog661": "The informational connection is easy to explain. If you know about the Decay, you become decayed. Then everything you touch or think about also becomes decayed.",
    "dialog662": "Temporal connection is more complicated.",
    "dialog663": "I have found out that the existence of the Decay at any point in time allows the Decay to spread through all temporal planes.",
    "dialog664": "To get the Decay I needed, I have built a device that stores and replicates decayed information.",
    "dialog665": "That is a very powerful informational connection and I was able to attract enough of the Decay to create the Decay Chamber.",
    "dialog666": "I believe that the Shatterers did the same.",
    "dialog667": "Wait, if the Decay spreads through time, doesn't that mean that everything is decaying?",
    "dialog668": "It does. The only way to stop the temporal spread is to destroy time itself.",
    "dialog669": "Fortunately, it will take millions of years for the Decay to gain critical presence through the non-physical spread.",
    "dialog670": "No more questions?",
    "dialog671": "No.",
    "dialog672": "Let's talk about the experiment then.",
    "dialog673": "What are you going to do?",
    "dialog674": "I have a theory that it's possible to use the Decay to transform matter without decaying it.",
    "dialog675": "To confirm it, I need to simulate the Decay and use it to warp this area. While we were traveling, I have assembled the projector that will create the simulation, so we can start now.",
    "dialog676": "Is it safe?",
    "dialog677": "Relatively.",
    "dialog678": "Like I said, it would be best to perform the experiment in an empty area.",
    "dialog679": "That's why I have taken you here. Let's do this.",
    "dialog680": "Great.",

    "dialog690": "When I will activate the projector, you will have to move through the simulated Decay and collect samples.",

    "dialog693": "I will keep altering the simulation to get the required data. All you need to do is move forward.",
    "dialog694": "Eliminate or avoid any obstacles you will encounter.",
    "dialog695": "If your spaceship will get destroyed, we will have to restart the simulation, so don't make mistakes.",
